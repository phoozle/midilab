This is the README file for Version 0.12.0 (January 2005) of the program mi2ly.
mi2ly is written in Ansi C and should compile with any decent C compiler.

On a typical Linux Box simply say ./cc in the download directory and then
copy the executable mi2ly somewhere in your path. The program is so small
and compiles so fast that I had no need for a Makefile.

This is alpha code I will appreciate very much bug reports and suggestions
for improvement and new features.

Refer to the file Doc.txt for hacking documentation and to the file
Manual.txt for a sort of manpage.
